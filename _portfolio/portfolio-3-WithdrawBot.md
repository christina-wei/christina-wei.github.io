## Project Overview
* User groups reflected desire for more digital capabilties such as chatbots for common 
* Wanted to explore chatbot capabilities within global wealth asset management

## My Contribution
* Product manager managing the initiative, working 2 engineers and 1 designer and 1 analyst

## Discovery
* Performed secondary research on chatbot usages and implementation guidelines through academic papers and competitor analysis
* Worked closely with product and operations teams to explore areas that are suitable for chatbot
* Job shadowed call center representatives to understand existing pain points
* Technical proof of concept to explore various frameworks and capabilities

## Pain Points
* Participants can only find out the status of their withdraw requests by phoning the call center
* Wait time is over 20 minutes to get through to a call representative, and they are only available Monday to Friday during work hours
* Need guidance to understand the different types of withdraws, but the website is difficult to navigate
* Anticipate high number of tax inquiries at the end of the year

## Ideation
* Given there was no direct access to participants, the team worked closely with call center representatives who frequently interacted with participants to design the dialog flow through a series of ideation sessions
* Created low fidelity prototypes for Q&A vs. open-text chatbot, created scenarios and posted on usertesting.com for feedback. Result showed that users preferred the structured approach of Q&A chabots given its limited scope
* Worked closely with product teams to design and integrate the chatbot into the existing website

## Pilot
* Limited scope with withdraw inquiries and basic tax questions
* Question-and-answer based implementation instead of open dialogue
* Survey for user feedback on experience and areas of improvement
* Tracking statistics on usage and areas of breakdown

## Outcome
* Over 1000 participants have accessed the chatbot, with 70% repeated users
* Demographics spread across different age groups and geographical locations
* Mixed feedback, users wanted more transactional capabilities (e.g. taking out a loan through the chatbot)
* Analyzed usage statistics, identified and prioritized areas for continuous development

## Technology Stack
* Microsoft Bot Framework
* NodeJS
* React
* PowerBI
