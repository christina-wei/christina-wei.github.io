# Project Overview

In this group project, we wanted to build a 'human' computational agent extending on critical perspectives on post-humanism, algorithms and biases. As a result, we built **FinaBot**, a wellness financial companion, as a speculative design artifact to prompt critical reflections and discussions from our audience.

FinaBot has the following capabilities:
- Embodied agent with anthropomorphic features such as human face, eyes that light up, hand that can lift up or down, and different sounds to express emotions
- Conversational dialog to discuss whether user should be allowed to withdraw money for various spending needs, and visually show decisiont hrough granted or denied lights
- Three curated interactions to experience different scenarios: 1) machines making decisions for humans, 2) humans forcefully override machine's decision, and 3) machines yielding to human decisions

# My Contributions

I designed the interaction flows and the curated scenarios to explore concepts from academic research. I also implemented the technical aspects of the prototype, such as coding logic for the Arduino device, and ensuring the components incorporated property with the agent's embodiment.
